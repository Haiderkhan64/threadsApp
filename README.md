## Why build the WebSocket server yourself?

Next.js App Router has no WebSocket support. The standard advice is to reach for a managed service. That's fine until you hit rate limits, vendor pricing, or need to actually understand what's happening inside your app.

This project boots Next.js programmatically inside `server.ts`, shares one HTTP server, and intercepts the `upgrade` event before Next.js ever sees it. `/ws/*` paths go to `ws`. Everything else goes to Next.js. One process, no proxy, no magic.

```ts
server.on("upgrade", (req, socket, head) => {
  if (pathname?.startsWith("/ws/")) {
    wss.handleUpgrade(req, socket, head, ...)
  } else {
    socket.write("HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found\r\n\r\n");
    socket.destroy();
  }
})
```

The tradeoff: you can't deploy this to Vercel or Netlify. You need a persistent process. Railway, Fly, Render, or a raw VM all work fine. That's an acceptable constraint.

## Architecture

```
Browser
  │
  ├─ HTTP ──────► Next.js App Router
  │                  ├─ MongoDB  (threads, users, communities, conversations, messages)
  │                  └─ UploadThing (image storage → CDN URLs)
  │
  └─ WebSocket ─► server.ts
                    ├─ /ws/chat/<roomId>/
                    │    └─ Redis pub/sub → two-stage fan-out across sockets
                    └─ /ws/video_call/
                         └─ Signaling relay → WebRTC P2P
```

**Chat uses Redis pub/sub** because the in-memory room registry (`Map<roomId, Set<WebSocket>>`) only works within a single Node process. The fan-out is two-stage: every incoming message is published to Redis, which broadcasts to all Node instances; each instance then fans out to its own local WebSocket connections for that room. Every message is also written to MongoDB with a 30-day TTL index — auto-deleted by the database, no cron needed. Message status (`delivered`, `read`) is also persisted to MongoDB so it survives reconnects.

**Video uses WebRTC** because 1-to-1 calls don't need a media server. The signaling layer relays `call-initiate`, `call-answer`, `ice-candidate`, `ice-restart`, `call-declined`, `call-end`, and `call-unavailable` between two clients, stamping `from: registeredUserId` on every relay. Once the P2P connection is established, the server is completely out of the media path. The tradeoff is that symmetric NAT traversal requires TURN — configured via env vars with a public fallback.

|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 14 (App Router) |
| Auth | Clerk |
| Database | MongoDB + Mongoose |
| Cache / Pub-Sub | Redis (ioredis) |
| Real-time | WebSocket (`ws`), WebRTC |

---

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- MongoDB instance (local or Atlas)
- Redis instance (local or managed)
- [Clerk](https://clerk.com) account
- [UploadThing](https://uploadthing.com) account

### Environment variables

```bash
# .env.local

# Clerk
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/onboarding

# Database
MONGODB_URL=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/threads_app

# Cache
REDIS_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:6379

# File uploads
UPLOADTHING_SECRET=sk_live_...
UPLOADTHING_APP_ID=...

# WebRTC TURN (optional — falls back through self-hosted → public STUN/TURN if omitted)
NEXT_PUBLIC_METERED_API_KEY=...
# — or self-hosted TURN —
NEXT_PUBLIC_TURN_HOST=your.turn.server
NEXT_PUBLIC_TURN_USER=username
NEXT_PUBLIC_TURN_CREDENTIAL=password
```

### Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev         # starts server.ts with tsx watch — Next.js + WS on :3000
```

### With Nix (zero-setup option)

The Nix flake auto-starts MongoDB and Redis in Docker, sets all env defaults, and gives you a reproducible shell.

```bash
nix develop         # or: direnv allow  (requires nix-direnv)
npm install
npm run dev
```

To stop the Docker containers:

```bash
cleanup_services
```

### Production

```bash
npm run build
npm start           # NODE_ENV=production tsx server.ts
```

## How the chat works

Three things that matter:

**1. Optimistic UI.** The sender sees their message immediately with `status: "sending"`. The server responds with `message_confirmed` carrying the real server ID. The client reconciles via `tempId`.

**2. Exactly-once rendering.** A `Set<string>` of seen message IDs lives in a component ref. History replay and live delivery can race on reconnect — the set deduplicates silently.

**3. Reconnect with history.** The client uses exponential backoff (`1000 * 2^attempt`, capped at 30s). On every new connection (including reconnects), the server replays the last 50 messages from MongoDB before any live events arrive.

Message flow:

```
Client                    Server               Redis
  │── send message ──────► │── save to Mongo ───►│
  │                        │── setex msg:* ─────►│
  │◄── message_confirmed ──│                     │
  │                        │ publish "chat" ──►  │
  │                        │◄─ sub receives ─────│
  │                        │── fan-out to room   │
  │◄─── (other clients) ───│                     │
```

**Message status lifecycle.** `sent` is set when MongoDB write completes. When the recipient's client receives a message, it sends a `delivered` event; when the user views it, it sends a `read` event. Both update MongoDB via `WsMessage.findOneAndUpdate` and fan out to the sender via Redis pub/sub so the sender's UI can show check marks in real time.

Typing indicators (`typing`) are the only truly ephemeral event — published to Redis, never written to MongoDB.

---

## How the video call works

The signaling server holds a `Map<userId, WebSocket>`. Every browser registers its Clerk user ID on connect. Messages are relayed directly to the target user ID — the server stamps `from: registeredUserId` on each relay but does not inspect the WebRTC SDP or ICE payloads themselves.

**Full signaling protocol:**

| Message type | Direction | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `register` | client → server | Associate Clerk userId with this socket |
| `registered` | server → client | Acknowledge registration |
| `call-initiate` | caller → server → callee | Start a call, carries offer SDP |
| `call-answer` | callee → server → caller | Accept, carries answer SDP |
| `ice-candidate` | either → server → other | Relay ICE candidate |
| `ice-restart` | either → server → other | Trigger ICE restart after failure |
| `call-declined` | callee → server → caller | Reject incoming call |
| `call-end` | either → server → other | Hang up |
| `call-unavailable` | server → caller | Target socket not found or not open |

```
Caller                Server (relay)               Callee
  │── register ──────────► │ ◄──────── register ───────│
  │── call-initiate ──────►│ ──── call-initiate ──────►│
  │                        │ ◄─── call-answer ─────────│
  │◄─── call-answer ───────│                           │
  │── ice-candidate ──────►│ ──── ice-candidate ──────►│
  │                        │                           │
  │            [P2P media — server is out]             │
```

ICE failure triggers automatic ICE restart (up to 2 attempts before teardown). A 5-second timer also triggers restart if the connection stays in `disconnected` state. Camera acquisition retries 3 times with 500ms backoff to handle the device-busy race that happens on rapid tab focus. If the camera is unavailable, it degrades to audio-only rather than blocking the call.

TURN server priority: Metered API → self-hosted → static public fallback. ICE servers are fetched once, cached at the module level for the entire session.

---

## Feed visibility

The home feed is not global. `fetchPost` resolves the current user's joined community IDs and applies:

```js
{
  parentId: { $in: [null, undefined] },    // top-level only
  $or: [
    { community: null },                   // public posts
    { community: { $in: joinedIds } },     // posts in joined communities
  ]
}
```

Users with no memberships see only public posts. Community content is gated — that's the point of communities.

> **Note on join/leave actions:** Two implementations exist side by side — `community.action.ts` handles MongoDB only, `membership.action.ts` additionally syncs with Clerk organizations. `JoinLeaveButton` uses the former; `JoinCommunityButton` uses the latter. Consolidation is a known TODO.

---

## Data models

**User** — Clerk `id`, `username`, `name`, `image`, `bio`, `onboarded`, refs to threads and communities.

**Thread** — `text`, `author`, `community` (null = public), `parentId` (null = top-level), `children`, `images` (UploadThing CDN URLs — up to 4 per post).

**Community** — unique `username` slug, `name`, `image`, `bio`, `createdBy`, `members[]`, `threads[]`. Creator is always a member and cannot leave — only delete.

**Conversation** — `participants: [ObjectId, ObjectId]`, `lastMessage`, `lastMessageAt`. Exists only for the messages list preview. The two-participant constraint is enforced at query time in `getOrCreateConversation` (`$size: 2`), not at the schema level.

**Message** — defined in `server.ts` (not in `lib/models/`), collection `"messages"`. Fields: `id`, `sender`, `senderName`, `content`, `room_id`, `timestamp`, `status` (`sent` | `delivered` | `read`), `expiresAt`. Two indexes: `{ room_id, timestamp }` for history queries, `{ expiresAt }` TTL for auto-expiry after 30 days.

---

## Deployment

This is a stateful Node.js process. It does not run on serverless platforms.

**Works on:** Railway, Fly.io, Render, any VM.

**Multi-instance:** Redis pub/sub handles chat fan-out correctly across instances — each instance subscribes to the `"chat"` channel and fans out to its own local WebSocket connections. Video signaling (`videoSockets` map) is in-memory per instance — you need sticky sessions or consistent hash routing for signaling to reach the right process. For most use cases a single instance is sufficient.

**Message expiry:** MongoDB auto-deletes messages after 30 days via the TTL index on `expiresAt`. No background worker needed.
